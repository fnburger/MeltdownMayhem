# MeltdownMayhem
Small video game project

## Project structure
The following lines show where assets are located in the project ("Type" --> "Folder").
Please use this structure to keep the project organized. Feel free to create Sub-folders when needed.

- Levels --> /Assets/Scenes
- Textures --> /Assets/Surfaces/ (create a folder here for each asset group containing the Albedo, Normals, etc.)
- Meshes --> /Assets/Models
- Materials --> /Assets/Materials
- Scripts --> /Assets/Scripts

## Git branches
**Never push to the master branch.** Always create your own branch first when creating a new feature. 
Then create a pull request to merge it with the develop branch, **but only if the feature is stable and works.**
