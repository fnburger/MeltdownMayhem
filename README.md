# MeltdownMayhem
Small video game project using Unity version 2021.3.19f1 LTS.

## Project Description
2-player split-screen racing game with interactable elements that can influence the environment as well as the gameplay experience of the players. The types of interaction between the players are going to be more competitive than collaborative. For example, players can influence the other players camera and controls through abilities.
The goal of each of the players will be to reach the goal before the other player does, or to stay alive for a longer time than the opponent. In order to reach their goal players will be able to interact with their environment in different ways. There will also be obstacles to overcome for both players.
