# MeltdownMayhem
Small video game project using Unity version 2021.3.19f1 LTS.

## Project Description
2-player split-screen racing game with interactable elements that can influence the environment as well as the gameplay experience of the players. The types of interaction between the players are going to be more competitive than collaborative. For example, players can influence the other players camera and controls through abilities.
The goal of each of the players will be to reach the goal before the other player does, or to stay alive for a longer time than the opponent. In order to reach their goal players will be able to interact with their environment in different ways. There will also be obstacles to overcome for both players.


## Project structure
The following lines show where assets are located in the project ("Type" --> "Folder").
Please use this structure to keep the project organized. Feel free to create Sub-folders when needed.

- Levels --> /Assets/Scenes
- Textures --> /Assets/Resources/Multimedia_image (create a folder here for each asset group containing the Albedo, Normals, etc.)
- Meshes --> /Assets/Resources/Models
- Materials --> /Assets/Resources/Materials
- Scripts --> /Assets/Scripts
- Assets from the Unity store --> /Assets/External

## Git branches
**Never push to the "master" branch.** Always create your own branch from the "develop" branch first starting to develop a new feature. 

Then create a pull request to merge it with the "develop" branch, **but only if the feature is stable and works.**
