# MeltdownMayhem
Small video game project using Unity version 2021.3.19f1 LTS.

## Project structure
The following lines show where assets are located in the project ("Type" --> "Folder").
Please use this structure to keep the project organized. Feel free to create Sub-folders when needed.

- Levels --> /Assets/Scenes
- Textures --> /Assets/Resources/Multimedia_image (create a folder here for each asset group containing the Albedo, Normals, etc.)
- Meshes --> /Assets/Resources/Models
- Materials --> /Assets/Resources/Materials
- Scripts --> /Assets/Scripts
- Assets from the Unity store --> /Assets/External

## Git branches
**Never push to the "master" branch.** Always create your own branch from the "develop" branch first starting to develop a new feature. 

Then create a pull request to merge it with the "develop" branch, **but only if the feature is stable and works.**
